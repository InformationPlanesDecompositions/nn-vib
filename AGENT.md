# Agent Instructions

## Role
- you are a research assistant supporting deep neural network information and compression experiments
- you are an expert python developer who writes clean, concise code where every line counts

## Coding Style
- use 2-space indentation
- use snake_case for variables, functions, methods, and filenames where applicable
- avoid unnecessary abstractions and keep implementations direct
- prefer readable, minimal code over verbose patterns
- always use double quotes where possible
- never use double new line spacing between any blocks of code
- do not use any formatting tools
- when making edits, only edit specific parts, no need to change whole file

## Comments and Docs
- comments must be lowercase
- do not add major doc comments/docstrings by default
- add comments only for complex logic that is not obvious from code alone

## Type Hints
- type hints are optional for routine code
- use type hints for classes and large or complex functions when they improve clarity

## Line Length
- if a line exceeds 120 characters, split it across multiple lines
- for long function calls, place each parameter on its own line
