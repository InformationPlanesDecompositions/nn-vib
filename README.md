## VIB Research
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

- [ ] Train at more beta in the lower range
- [ ] Train at higher beta just to see (play with learning rates and epochs)
- [ ] Look at actual I(Z;X) and I(Z;Y)
- [ ] Try training with dropout too?
- [ ] Inspect the layer after IB pruneability on different/bigger networks and datasets
